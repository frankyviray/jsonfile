They give you a super clean cut in any grade aluminum plate, bar, or rod.</P> <P>        The material stays cool and ready to use right after cutting because all the heat is transferred to the blade.  Also, there is no de-burring, all the edges are ready to use. It's the only blade on the market like it.</P> <P>      These blades cut more accurately and last longer than cutoff wheels, band saw blades, and sawzall blades, and, they're faster because you actually mill out the metal by pushing through the material quickly.</P>"

Scotch-Brite Roloc Bristle Disc works well on steel, aluminum and a variety of other metals, in general maintenance, as well as automotive and engine rebuilding applications. 3M&reg; Ceramic Abrasive Grain is a ceramic mineral manufactured using our proprietary process to enhance toughness and hardness of the grain. For increased performance, Scotch-Brite Bristle Discs feature aluminum oxide blended with ceramic abrasive grain for one of the hardest, longest-lasting minerals available. Perfect for moderate to heavy stock removal, ceramic abrasives are engineered to cut fast and handle intense heat and stress applications. 3M&reg; Ceramic Abrasive Grain surpasses aluminum oxide abrasives in cut-rate, durability, and makes an excellent choice for industrial grinding and finishing applications. 3M&reg; Ceramic Abrasive Grain surpasses aluminum oxide abrasives in cut-rate, durability, and makes an excellent choice for industrial grinding and finishing applications. Scotch-Brite abrasives are unique surface conditioning products with abrasives incorporated into non-woven fiber matrix. Combining abrasives and non-woven material creates an abrasive system that gives you consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material runs cool and is load resistant, which keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the fibers. ONLY SOLD IN 10-PACKS.</P>"

They're pure cobalt drill bits that will actually go through Titanium.</P> <P>                 Each bit has a 135&deg; split tip so you don't need a starter bit and best of all the flute offers fast chip removal for drilling quick and accurate holes.  These are the best bits we carry and they will go through the hardest metals you can find. Size ranges from 1/16\" to 1/4\" by 64ths. </P>"

They are a hi-moly bit, specially ground with a thinner web to cut easily under the work hardened surface of any material. They drill 30% faster than Cobalt bits and last longer too. They have 135_ split points which make them self-starting, self-centering, and self tapping.</P> <P>      These bits have three flats ground into the shank to prevent 'spinning' in the chuck. They also have the cut-down shanks on the bits over 3/8\" so they will fit into any drill.</P>"

They'll cut razor sharp holes through stainless steel, spring steel, and grade 8 bolts without chipping or breaking and you can't mix them up with other bits because where the flutes are cut, they're bright gold in color.These bits will drill 30% faster than Cobalt because they have the thinner web. They also have the 135º split point which makes these bits self-starting, self-centering, and self-tapping so you don't need a starter bit or a punch and they will drill through 1/4\" trailer hitch plate like a hot knife through butter!This set has a reduced 1/2\" shank with three flat sides and can be used in a drill press or a regular hand drill without slipping. This is a 4 piece set that includes 9/16\",5/8\", 3/4\", and 1\"</P>"

    "description": "<P>These are the VIPER 'Super Premium'. This set was manufactured specifically for Ace and is absolutely the greatest S & D bits on the market. They'll cut razor sharp holes through stainless steel, spring steel, and grade 8 bolts without chipping or breaking and you can't mix them up with other bits because where the flutes are cut, they're bright gold in color.These bits will drill 30% faster than Cobalt because they have the thinner web. They also have the 118&deg; split point which makes these bits self-starting, self-centering, and self-tapping so you don't need a starter bit or a punch and they will drill through 1/4\" trailer hitch plate like a hot knife through butter!This set has a reduced 1/2\" shank with three flat sides and can be used in a drill press or a regular hand drill without slipping. This is a 8 piece set that includes 9/16\",5/8\", 11/16\", 3/4\", 13/16\", 7/8\", 15/16\" and 1\"</P>"

The internal mechanisms include high speed turbines, high quality bearing surfaces and air chambers, and very low decibel exhaust through the handle instead of the front, so there's no more 'blow-by' in the lungs and eyes.  </P> <P>    These wrenches have a twin clutch design, so you get high torque with a sound pressure of only 86 decibels. You get more power and half the noise with their tuned exhaust. </P> <P>   They feature 400 Lbs of loosening torque and 50 to 350 Lbs. of working torque. The composite housing and aluminum hammer make it light weight at only 2 3/4 Lbs. and the mini size allows you to get into tight places with more working room.

    "description": "<P>      These cable ties meet NEC regulations for bundling qualified conduit in plenum rated (air handling spaces) as described in NFPA 70-1996 National Electrical Code section 300-22.  </P> <P>      Plenum environments are areas through which air handling mechanisms (ducts, vents) are routed, for example, the area between a drop-in ceiling and the real ceiling. These areas have very special requirements because any non -metallic component in these air spaces will fuel a fire.  </P> <P>     These ties are tested for the amount of smoke and heat generated during a fire per UL 2043. They also meet UL 94V-O flammability rating; however they are not rated for interior duct use.</P> <P>      These UL listed ties are rated in plenums as defined in the NEC 300-22, sections C & D only. This excludes ducts or plenums used for environmental air, dust, or vapor removal. They are color coded red or white. USA MADE UL APPROVED.</P>"

The strong, lightweight fiberglass pole telescopes to 12 feet with an infinitely adjustable twist-lock extender and non-pinching twist-lock adjustment. The unique internal stop prevents the inner pole from separating from the outer pole and the pole features a comfortable non-slip 24-inch cushioned grip to relieve hand and muscle stress.</P>"
